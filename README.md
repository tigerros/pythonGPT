# PythonGPT

The name might sound trendy, but it's just a lame school project.
The task was to make a simple chatbot, but I decided to use the ChatGPT API. Not directly, but through [BotLibre](https://www.botlibre.com), because it's free.

You need a file called `application_id.txt` in the folder where the file you're executing is located that contains the BotLibre application ID.
You can get it by creating a BotLibre account, navigating to user details and clicking the "Obtain" button next to the "Application ID" field.
