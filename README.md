# PythonGPT

The name might sound trendy, but it's just a lame school project.
The task was to make a simple chatbot, but I decided to use the ChatGPT API. Not directly, but through [BotLibre](https://www.botlibre.com), because it's free.

You need two files: `application_id.txt` and `instance_id.txt` in the folder where the file you're executing is located.

You can get the application ID by creating a BotLibre account, navigating to user details and clicking the "Obtain" button next to the "Application ID" field.

You can get the instance ID by browsing the BotLibre bots and viewing the details. It is left at a default value which is the GPT-3 bot.
